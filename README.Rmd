This repository contains the raw data and R scripts for "UV radiation affects anti-predatory defense traits in *Daphnia pulex*" by Eshun-Wilson *et al.*, 2020. A link to the final version of the article will be added here in the future. 

The `data` folder contains the raw data used for the analyses, and the `scripts` folder contains the R scripts which were written for the analyses. The fitted models are in the `models` folder, and all graphics are in the `figures` folder. 

The following R package needs to be installed to run the analysis:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages("brms")
```

Additionally, all graphics require the `tidyverse` package collection, especially `ggplot2`, and `patchwork`. They can be installed as follows:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "patchwork"))
```
